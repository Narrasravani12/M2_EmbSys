# Working principle

The proposed system is designed to control a circuit with the help of a Password on a keypad, which is connected to the project . The controlling of this project can be done by an 8051 family microcontroller. A matrix keypad is connected to the microcontroller to enter the password .The entered password is compared with the stored password in the ROM of the microcontroller .If the given password is right, then only the line can be switched ON/OFF. The circuit system Activation/deactivation is indicated by a lamp (ON/OFF). Further this project can been enhanced by using an EEPROM for the user to modify the password for a more protected system. It can also be interfaced with a GSM modem for remotely controlling the electronic circuit system through SMS.

# AT89C51 Microcontroller
Originally,8051 microcontrollers were developed using N-MOS Technology but the use of battery powered devices and their low power consumption lead to usage of CMOS Technology (which is famous for its low power consumption). 8051 microcontroller is designed by Intel in 1981. It is an 8-bit microcontroller. It is built with 40pins DIP(dualinlinepackage), 4kb of ROM storage and 128 bytes of RAM storage, 216-bittimers. It consists of are four parallel 8-bitports, which are programmable as well as addressable as per the requirement. A non-chipcrystal oscillator is integrated in the microcontroller having crystal frequency of 12MHz.
# 4X4 Matrix Keypad
The 4*4 matrix keypad usually is used as input in a project. It has 16 keys in total, which means the same input values. The Sun Founer 4*4 Matrix Keypad Module is a matrix non -encoded keypad consisting of 16 keys in parallel . The keys of each row and column are connected through the pins outside{pinY1-Y4 as labelled beside control the rows, when X1-X4, the columns.

# 16X2 LCD Display

## Liquid Crystal Display
LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display which is an electronic display module. These are widely used in electronic applications.These are also used in CD players, DVD players , digital watches, computers etc.. Commonly these are used in the screen industries to replace the utilisation of CRT's (cathode ray tubes) which use huge power in compared with LCD's.
# Relays
The relay is an electromagnetic switch,used to control the electrical de-vices.Copper core magnetic ux plays the main role here.The relay's switch connections are usually labelled COM,NC,and NO.COM=Common,always connect to this,it is the moving part of the switch.NC=Normally Closed,COM is connected to this when the relay coil.
# ULN2003A IC
The ULN IC is the most commonly used Motor driver IC. This IC is used to drive very high current loads with the help of digital logic circuits like operational
ampliers,Timers,Gates,aurdino etc... This is a 16 pin IC, in which there are 7 Darlington pairs, each can drive the loads in the range of 50V and 500 mA. These Darlington pairs have 7 input pins and 7 output pins, and other are a common pin and a ground pin.
# Buzzer
A buzzer is a Audio signal Device which lets the audio out of it mechanically. These are basically used in alarm devices, timers etc... A buzzer is a very tiny device but also an eective one to integrate audio features to any of the projects. The features of the buzzer are voltage rate - 6V DC operating Voltage - 4-8 V DC Current Rating - upto 30mA Audio Type - a continuous beep Frequency resonated - upto 2300Hz.
